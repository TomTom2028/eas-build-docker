# Eas Build Docker 2223
Currently there isn't a good way to build expo android apps locally, hence this repo.

The docker image is build with java, android sdk, nodejs, eas all preinstalled.

The compose file is for building a version of this locally, should you want this.

`docker compose up --build`
